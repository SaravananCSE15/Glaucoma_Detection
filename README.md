# **Here's a high-level overview of the project steps:**

1.**Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather a labeled dataset of glaucoma and non-glaucoma eye images. Preprocess the images by resizing, normalization, etc., to prepare them for the model.
2.**Model Training**: Train the DenseNet201 model on the preprocessed dataset, fine-tuning the pre-trained weights for glaucoma detection.
3.**Web App Development**: Create a Streamlit app with functionalities for image upload, prediction display, and informative disclaimers.
4.**Deployment**: Deploy the Streamlit app to a platform (locally or cloud-based) where users can access it through a web browser.
